Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles, which specify how to derive the target program from its dependencies.

Makefiles are text files that contain a set of rules and directives for the make utility to follow in order to build a target. These rules specify dependencies between files and commands to be executed to build or update target files. Makefiles typically consist of rules, comments, variables, and directives.
